Reflecting on my transformative journey with the Computer Vision and Sensing Systems (COVISS) Lab at the University of Florida, I am overwhelmed with profound appreciation 🙏. My two-year tenure has been an extraordinary chapter of professional growth 📈, marked by incredible camaraderie and groundbreaking research 🚀. 

The memories and connections forged during this time are truly irreplaceable 💖, and I feel immensely privileged to have collaborated with such an exceptional team of researchers and innovators 🤝👩‍💻👨‍💻. 

As I depart, I extend my heartfelt wishes for continued excellence and pioneering advancements to this remarkable laboratory 🌟. May the spirit of curiosity and collaborative innovation that defines COVISS continue to propel cutting-edge research in computer vision and sensing systems 🔍✨! 

Farewell, COVISS Lab - you've been an incredible journey! 👋🎓

  During my time, I was involved in several cutting-edge research projects:

1. **Long-term Visual Place Recognition:** I developed a graph-based image feature representation to address the dynamic nature of regions, incorporating semantic information to enhance place recognition capabilities.

2. **Calibration-free Multi-view Detection and Association:** This project focused on leveraging occlusion to improve MODA and MODP in multi-view object detection. I implemented attention networks to enable calibration-free optimization of multi-view detection systems.

3. **End-to-End Detection, Segmentation, and Tracking:** Our goal was to surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for the MOTS challenge through this innovative project.

Additionally, I co-supervised the ABE Robotics team as they prepared for the ASABE Robotics Student Design Competition, 2024, in Anaheim, California. Throughout these projects, I managed documentation and code versioning, with all projects being trained on high-performance computing infrastructure.
