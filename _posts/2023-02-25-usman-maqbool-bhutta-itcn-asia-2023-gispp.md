**TechSec 2023** - Bridging the Gaps Conference organized by GISPP was held in :triangular_flag_on_post: **ITCN Asia 2023**, PAK-China Friendship Centre, Islamabad.

I emphasize taking the voluntary initiative by the tech industry first. Companies should realize that they need academic involvement to grow at a swift pace. Most VPs of big companies belong to academia. In return, companies would at least solve their quality hiring problems. Usually, universities need more funding for R&D and IP filings, etc. In a broader view, both could get huge benefits.
