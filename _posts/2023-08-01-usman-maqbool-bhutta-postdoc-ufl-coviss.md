I'm very pleased to start work with Prof. Darwin Lau's group at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (#39 in QS Global World Rankings 2022), Hong Kong.

I will be working to several ongoing projects such as AR/VR, Multi-agent robotics for agriculture, Painting / pre-surface inspection robotics for constructions at C3 Robotics Lab, Chinese University Robotics Institute (CURI), CUHK.
