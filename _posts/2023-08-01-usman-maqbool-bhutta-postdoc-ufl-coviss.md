I'm very pleased to start work with Prof. Dr. Henry Medeiros's group at University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.

I will be working on several ongoing projects, such as long-term visual place recognition, multi-object tracking and association, and fruit segmentation and tracking for agricultural robotics.
