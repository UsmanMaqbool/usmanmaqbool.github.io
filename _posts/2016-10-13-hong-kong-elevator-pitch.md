It was a great opportunity to meet with 500+ entrepreneurs, accelerators, incubators and investors at the tallest building in Hong Kong. I enjoyed a variety of fun activities and networking opportunities with an amazing line-up of start-ups, accelerators, incubators and investors there.

100 burgeoning start-ups are competing by pitching in front of a panel of investors and experts during the 60-second elevator ride.
