## What Is Cognitive Bias?

Let’s start off with a **basic cognitive bias** definition: It is a systematic error in cognitive processes (like thinking, perceiving, and memory) diverging from rationality, which can affect judgments. If we think of the human brain as a computer, cognitive bias basically is an error in the code, making us perceive the input differently or come up with an output that’s illogical.

## Explained
*   **Fundamental Attribution Error**: We judge others on their personality or fundamental character, but we judge ourselves on the situation.
*   **Self-Serving Bias:** Our failures are situational, but our successes are our responsibility.
*   **In-Group Favoritism:** We favor people who are in our in-group as opposed to an out-group.
*   **Bandwagon Effect:** Ideas, fads, and beliefs grow as more people adopt them.
*   **Groupthink:** Due to a desire for conformity and harmony in the group, we make irrational decisions, often to minimize conflict.
*   **Halo Effect:** If you see a person as having a positive trait, that positive impression will spill over into their other traits. (This also works for negative traits.)
*   **Moral Luck**: Better moral standing happens due to a positive outcome; worse moral standing happens due to a negative outcome.
*   **False Consensus**: We believe more people agree with us than is actually the case.
*   **Curse of Knowledge**: Once we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too.
*   **Spotlight Effect**: We overestimate how much people are paying attention to our behavior and appearance.
*   **Availability Heuristic**: We rely on immediate examples that come to mind while making judgments.
*   **Defensive Attribution**: As a witness who secretly fears being vulnerable to a serious mishap, we will blame the victim less if we relate to the victim.
*   **Just-World Hypothesis:** We tend to believe the world is just; therefore, we assume acts of injustice are deserved.
*   **Naïve Realism**: We believe that we observe objective reality and that other people are irrational, uninformed, or biased.
*   **Naïve Cynicism**: We believe that we observe objective reality and that other people have a higher egocentric bias than they actually do in their intentions/actions.
*   **Forer Effect (aka Barnum Effect)**: We easily attribute our personalities to vague statements, even if they can apply to a wide range of people.
*   **Dunning-Kruger Effect**: The less you know, the more confident you are. The more you know, the less confident you are.
*   **Anchoring**: We rely heavily on the first piece of information introduced when making decisions.
*   **Automation Bias**: We rely on automated systems, sometimes trusting too much in the automated correction of actually correct decisions.
*   **Google Effect (aka Digital Amnesia):** We tend to forget information that’s easily looked up in search engines.
*   **Reactance:** We do the opposite of what we’re told, especially when we perceive threats to personal freedoms.
*   **Confirmation Bias**: We tend to find and remember information that confirms our perceptions.
*   **Backfire Effect**: Disproving evidence sometimes has the unwarranted effect of confirming our beliefs.
*   **Third-Person Effect**: We believe that others are more affected by mass media consumption than we ourselves are.
*   **Belief Bias**: We judge an argument’s strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but how plausible the conclusion is in our own minds.
*   **Availability Cascade:** Tied to our need for social acceptance, collective beliefs gain more plausibility through public repetition.
*   **Declinism**: We tent to romanticize the past and view the future negatively, believing that societies/institutions are by and large in decline.
*   **Status Quo Bias**: We tend to prefer things to stay the same; changes from the baseline are considered to be a loss.
*   **Sunk Cost Fallacy (aka Escalation of Commitment)**: We invest more in things that have cost us something rather than altering our investments, even if we face negative outcomes.
*   **Gambler’s Fallacy**: We think future possibilities are affected by past events.
*   **Zero-Risk Bias**: We prefer to reduce small risks to zero, even if we can reduce more risk overall with another option.
*   **Framing Effect:** We often draw different conclusions from the same information depending on how it’s presented.
*   **Stereotyping**: We adopt generalized beliefs that members of a group will have certain characteristics, despite not having information about the individual.
*   **Outgroup Homogeneity Bias**: We perceive out-group members as homogeneous and our own in-groups as more diverse.
*   **Authority Bias**: We trust and are more often influenced by the opinions of authority figures.
*   **Placebo Effect**: If we believe a treatment will work, it often will have a small physiological effect.
*   **Survivorship Bias**: We tend to focus on those things that survived a process and overlook ones that failed.
*   **Tachypsychia**: Our perceptions of time shift depending on trauma, drug use, and physical exertion.
*   **Law of Triviality (aka “Bike-Shedding”)**: We give disproportionate weight to trivial issues, often while avoiding more complex issues.
*   **Zeigarnik Effect**: We remember incomplete tasks more than completed ones.
*   **IKEA Effect**: We place higher value on things we partially created ourselves.
*   **Ben Franklin Effect**: We like doing favors; we are more likely to do another favor for someone if we’ve already done a favor for them than if we had _received_ a favor from that person.
*   **Bystander Effect**: The more other people are around, the less likely we are to help a victim.
*   **Suggestibility**: We, especially children, sometimes mistake ideas suggested by a questioner for memories.
*   **False Memory**: We mistake imagination for real memories.
*   **Cryptomnesia**: We mistake real memories for imagination.
*   **Clustering Illusion**: We find patterns and “clusters” in random data.
*   **Pessimism Bias**: We sometimes overestimate the likelihood of bad outcomes.
*   **Optimism Bias**: We sometimes are over-optimistic about good outcomes.
*   **Blind Spot Bias**: We don’t think we have bias, and we see it others more than ourselves.
