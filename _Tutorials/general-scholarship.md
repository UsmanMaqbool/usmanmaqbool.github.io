## Golden Tips
### Prerequisite

1. **CV** (Best practice is to update frequently, add whatever you have)
2. **Cover Letter / Why you** (make shorts 5-6 key points of having you)

### List All Professors
Make a list of all the relevent Profs. and write your `Research Statement` according to the **Target Prof.'s Research Interest**
> This is the most important part, which actually students dont care before sending any email to the target Prof.
> To Write Reserach Statement:
> * **Read** at least 3-4 papers of the target Prof. and check his recent research directions.
> * **Align** your previous work to the Prof. research directions. 
>
> Why: Because usually Profs. have fundings related to their **recent** projects. In this manner, they are likely to reply you.
 
### Email
1. Email you CV + Cover letter + Research statement to the Prof.
2. If you didnt get any reply, send them reminder after a week.

### Have GRE/IELTS
If you have GRE/ILETS + Publications, then try top universites in the US/Canada, Switzerland, UK, Australia.

### With NO IELTES/GRE
In that case, try HK ([HKPFS](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html)), Japan, China or Korea. 

### Funding Problem
Only if Prof. show interests from top university (oxford/Cambridge/ETH etc). Tell them you can arrage fundings.
You can easily grab funding using [CMMS-PEEF](https://peef.org.pk/cmms) Scholarship.

> PROS: You can get degree from Top university.
> 
> CONS: Usually monthly stipend is bit lower then the university's one. (I think not a big deal).

### When to start contacting profs.
Usually between July-Sept is the ideal time to contact.

### Useful link for scholarship news / help
Scholarship Network at Facebook [[Link](https://www.facebook.com/groups/scholarships.pk)]

### Top University Matters?
Yes, you are likely to get higher salary.
