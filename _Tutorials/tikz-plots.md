## Tikz Plots

Tikz plots are very useful to add graphs in your publication.

### Example

<img src="/assets/images/learn/latex-tikz.png" alt="tikz-latex-plot-graph" />

I use `dat` file for each curve of a graph. Consider, you have 3 curves. You put data of each curve to its corresponding file, and follow the step below for plotting. Its simple text file with extension `dat`. You can choose any other extension too. It is two columns file. First column corresponds to the x-axis values and second column corresponds to y-axis.

```
1 64.444
2 67.937
3 70.794
4 73.333
5 73.968
```
#### Explanation

Since most of the plots have some similar axis's information, so
`tikz-graph-in-latex/tikz_styles.tex` file is used for controlling default values. For instance, X-Y ticks and X-Y labels defaults values can be assigned in this `tikz_styles.tex` file.

##### X-Y Ticks
Open the file `tikz-graph-in-latex/tikz_styles.tex` and change xtick and ytick like below
```tex
xtick={0,5,10,15,20,25},
ytick={45,50,55,60,65,70,75,80,85,90,95,100},
```

##### X-Y Labels
Open the file `tikz-graph-in-latex/tikz_styles.tex` and change xtick and ytick like below
```tex
xlabel={X-axis description},
ylabel={Y-axis description},
```

##### Y-Axis Max and Min
Sometimes, Y-axis doesn't fit the plot well. So we control y-axis for each plot in the `main.tex` file.

Open the file ` tikz-graph-in-latex/main.tex` and change xtick and ytick like below
```tex
\pgfplotsset{ymax=82, ymin= 49}
```
Similarly, you can also control x-axix min and max value.

##### Curve Settings
Open the file ` tikz-graph-in-latex/main.tex` and change color, mark, size and line width for each curve accordingly.
```tex
\addplot [color=blue, mark=diamond, mark size=3pt, line width=0.8pt]
```
