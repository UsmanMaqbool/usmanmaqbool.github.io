## Tikz Plots

Tikz plots are very useful to add graphs in your publication.

### Example
I use `dat` file for each curve of a graph. Consider, you have 3 curves. You put data of each curve to its corresponding file, and follow the step below for plotting.


**Soft-Indicator Function:**

**Vectors:** (10-dimensional)  ${\color{blue}{x_i}}, i = \{1,2,...,250\}$

**Clusters:** (say 5), 10-dimensional each $\mathbf{\color{red}{c_k}}, {k}=1,...,5$



The $J^{th}$ column of $\mathbf{V}$ for every $J(j = 1,2,...,5)$

NetVLAD {% cite netvlad %} is using it
